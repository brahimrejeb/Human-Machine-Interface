Here are the different plots that were made to analyze each type of measurement 
and to find which one will be the more precise for movement detection. 

In the name of each plot, the first part correspond to the position of the hand with respect
 to the Leap Motion (10cm, 15cm and 45 degree, 20cm). The second part correspond to the type of measurement : 

meta_distal_angle : angle between the metacarpal and disal bone of each finger
palm_distal_angle : angle between the palm normal vector and disal bone of each finger
palm_tip_distance : distance between the center of the palm and the tip of each finger
prox_distal_angle : angle between the proximal and the disal bone of each finger

The angle are in [rad], distance in [mm] and the x axis correspond to time (frame number)
