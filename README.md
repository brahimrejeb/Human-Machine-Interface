# Development of human-machine interface based on detection of fingers movements

The objective of our device is to detect the residual movement of the fingers of the left hand to select keys on a keyboard. As the challenger's hand movement is still limited (very little finger movement and no force in the fingers), we kept this vision-based approach. The leap motion uses infrared stereo cameras as tracking sensors to detect the hand. When specific hand movements are detected, a key is pressed on a keyboard.
